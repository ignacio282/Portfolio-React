We analyzed website traffic and found that Credit Cards, Investments, Accounts, and Loans attracted 80% of engagement. To focus our redesign, we surveyed 50,000 clients who used these products in a period of 6 months. By combining survey data with demographic insights, we created user personas that guided our user-centric design, ensuring the redesign met the expectations of Banco Pichincha's diverse customer base",
                "The user personas we developed from the quantitative and qualitative data revealed what our clients were truly looking for on the website. We discovered that users weren’t visiting pages we had assumed were important to them. We also learned how they navigated the site, what devices they used, when they browsed, and what specific information they sought. This crucial insight allowed us to build a research plan tailored to actual user behavior, ensuring our redesign focused on their real needs.",

              "The main issue with the website was its navigation and information architecture. We knew firsthand—through feedback from clients and business stakeholders—that many pages were not achieving the expected results. Users either couldn’t find them, they were located in the wrong places, or even if found, they didn’t communicate the right information.",
              "To improve this, we first had to identify the most important pages on the site—a challenging task given that the site has around 400 pages. We relied on Google Analytics data to identify which pages had the most visits. We also used the user personas we had previously created to understand what users expected from these pages, where they navigated from, what time they did so, and other relevant details.",
              " Once we identified the crucial pages, we began placing them within the proposed new architecture, initially by affinity and content. We then validated this grouping with stakeholders to ensure it made sense for the business. After confirming that the bank agreed with the grouping, we started user testing. The primary test was tree testing—a method that helps validate navigation. Users were given the task of finding a page and had to navigate through a prototype to locate it. This demonstrated that the proposed locations were correct, and we replicated this process for the rest of the prioritized pages"

The important pages were improved, and through a series of tests like tree testing, we identified the optimal location in the new architecture for users to find them. For pages that seemed less important, we interviewed clients and stakeholders to determine if these pages were still necessary or if we could eliminate them to reduce the noise they created for users."
